            <h2>My Journey from Math to Code</h2>
            <p>My journey into coding began with a deep love for mathematics. For me, life is math applied. The logical structures and problem-solving skills I developed through studying math naturally led me to the world of programming. Transitioning from math to code felt like a seamless extension of my passion for analytical thinking and precision. Coding allows me to apply mathematical concepts in practical and innovative ways, making it a perfect fit for my skills and interests.
                <br><br>
                Joining 1337 has been a transformative experience. The rigorous training and collaborative environment have significantly enhanced my coding skills. The peer-to-peer learning model at 1337 has not only improved my technical abilities but also taught me the importance of teamwork and continuous learning. This journey has been challenging yet incredibly rewarding, and it has solidified my commitment to a career in technology.
            </p>
            <p class="p3">I have recently developed an interest in data analysis. Although I am just beginning my learning journey and have not yet worked on real-world projects, I am excited about the potential of data analysis to uncover insights and drive decision-making. I am currently focusing on building my skills in this area and look forward to applying them in future projects.</p>
